# AutoRest Compare

`autorest-compare` provides a regression testing tool which can compare the
output of two AutoRest runs to determine whether there are any material changes
to the generated source for a given service spec.  Comparisons can be made between:

- Versions of the AutoRest CLI (v2 versus v3)
- Versions of AutoRest Core
- Versions of the AutoRest modeler
- Versions of a language generator

The primary use case for this tool is to determine whether changes to the
[AutoRest v3 modeler](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.modelerfour) have
changed the output of the various language generators in undesirable ways.

## Installation

This tool is written for Node.js [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), so make sure
to have that installed before continuing (we recommend 10.16.x LTS).

With Node.js installed, you can install `autorest-compare` by running the
following command:

```shell
npm install -g @autorest/compare
```

If you'd prefer not to install this tool globally, you can use the following
command to invoke it with [`npx`] on a one-shot basis:

```
npx @autorest/compare [arguments]
```

**NOTE:** Some dependencies contain native code components that need to be
compiled before they can be used so you'll need to have the appropriate C
compiler and Python 2.7/3.5 or greater installed on your machine before using
this tool.

### Windows

If you don't already have Python and the MS Visual Studio C++ compiler tools
installed, you can easily install them with the following command:

```shell
npm install --global windows-build-tools
```

### Linux

Install gcc and  . For Debian/Ubuntu, the following command should work:

```shell
sudo apt-get install build-essential python
```

### macOS

On macOS, Python should be installed by default.  The C/C++ compiler can be
installed with XCode by running the following command:

```shell
xcode-select --install
```

## Running `autorest-compare`

Running `autorest-compare --help` will display the list of arguments you might
wish to use.  Specific usage scenarios are described in the following sections.

* Comparing the Python output between two versions of `@autorest/modelerfour`:

  ```shell
  autorest-compare --python --spec-path path/to/spec.json \
    --output-path path/to/output \
    --compare-old --use:@autorest/modelerfour@4.1.59 \
    --compare-new --use:@autorest/modelerfour@4.1.60
  ```

* Comparing the TypeScript output of generating a set of specs in the
  `azure-rest-api-specs` repository between AutoRest v2 and AutoRest v3:

  ```shell
  autorest-compare --typescript \
    --spec-root-path:../path/to/azure-rest-api-specs/specifications \
    --spec-path:redis/resource-manager \
    --spec-path:keyvault/resource-manager \
    --output-path path/to/output \
    --compare-old --version:^2.0.0 \
    --compare-new --version:3.0.6179
  ```

  Note that the `--spec-path` parameter can be passed multiple times to include
  multiple specs in a single run.
